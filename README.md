# Stock Price Prediction Project


### Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data. The goal is to create a model that can accurately forecast future stock prices based on past performance. This project is ideal for those interested in understanding how machine learning models can be applied to financial data.

**Important:** This project was created for educational purposes only. Consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Historical stock price data is used to train the model. The data includes daily prices over a specified period.
- **Feature Engineering:** The project involves creating meaningful features from the historical data, such as moving averages or other relevant indicators.
- **Model Training:** A machine learning model is trained to predict future stock prices based on the engineered features.
- **Prediction:** The model can predict stock prices for dates not present in the original dataset.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and preprocessing
  - `matplotlib` for data visualization
- **Model:** Linear Regression (or other chosen models)
- **Data:** Historical stock price data

### How to Use

1. **Data Preparation:** Gather historical stock price data and preprocess it.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create features that will be used by the model to make predictions.
3. **Train the Model:** Use the historical data to train the model.
4. **Make Predictions:** Predict stock prices for future dates using the trained model.
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy using evaluation metrics.

### Conclusion

This project is a practical introduction to applying machine learning to financial data. It demonstrates the full process from data collection and feature engineering to model training and prediction. The project is designed to be accessible, making it a great starting point for those interested in financial forecasting using machine learning.
